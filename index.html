                <p>Efpalinos Meletitiki was formed in 1999 to provide in Cyprus a single source for a comprehensive
                    range of high quality services in the field of Civil Engineering and Transportation. Single
                    sourcing is particularly important for providing consulting services within the working
                    environment of Cyprus - a relatively limited geographical area, but applying state of the art
                    technologies and knowledge is mostly necessary to serve the increasing demands of local economy
                    at the highest standards.</p>

                        Community service, intelligent development and quality of life. For us, this is what civil
                        engineering is about. As we shape our communities, we enjoy both “pure” engineering as well as
                        agency coordination and public involvement. As civil engineers, our clients task us to develop
                        creative, cost-effective solutions to oftentimes challenging problems. We routinely provide
                        solutions for coordination of multiple private and public utilities in densely populated
                        activity
                        centers, for protecting critical infrastructure from rising flood waters, for sequencing the
                        work in
                        order to minimize the construction schedule and for providing aesthetic and cost-effective,
                        functional designs.
                        Efpalinos Consulting provides comprehensive civil engineering services, including project
                        development and management, design and construction oversight for all types of infrastructure
                        projects. Our experience includes land and site development, public and private utility systems,
                        drainage studies and streetscape improvement projects.

                        Today’s motorists demand transportation facilities that are safe, attractive, easy-to-navigate
                        and efficient.
                        As transportation providers across the country plan solutions that increase or optimize the
                        capacity of transportation networks,
                        creative design approaches are required to balance design with the environment and future
                        growth.
                        At Efpalinos Consulting, we understand land-use impacts of transportation improvements, the need

                    <p>
                        “Smart” parking solutions consider the interaction of cars and people. Our understanding of the
                        function and operations of parking places, together with our engineering expertise, results in
                        parking facilities that are integrated, economical, durable and attractive. Our engineers work
                        closely with owners and architects to develop parking facility designs that meet their
                        operational and management needs.

                    <p>
                        A well-planned and functioning parking place is more profitable, better utilized and, of course,
                        preferred by customers. We handle all aspects of parking facility design, from master planning
                        to design and through construction. The internal workings of a parking place, such as parking
                        access and revenue control equipment and vehicular and pedestrian way-finding graphics, are an
                        integral part of the parking place design process.

                    <p>
                        Our custom designs take all of these aspects into account to provide a superior customer
                        experience. When the facility is complete, we provide operational consulting services to help
                        keep the parking place in working order.

                    <p>We help architects and owners create beautiful buildings that work through our solid technical
                        engineering skills and creative spark that continually asks, "How can we do this better, more
                        imaginatively, more innovatively?" As structural engineers for so many landmark structures,
                        we're leading the pack—not following it. We are at the forefront of building design technology
                        through the early adoption and firm-wide use of BIM. Our engineers are in leading roles in
                        shaping building codes, seismic and wind design codes, and concrete, steel, and other structural
                        material standards throughout the industry. </p>

                        as parking consulting and structural diagnostics help us deliver more than our clients expect.

                        creating buildings that solve environmental problems, both for the physical environment, through
                        such criteria as energy efficiency and materials selection, and for the indoor environmental
                        quality of building occupants. We have long been committed to sustainability and to finding ways
                        of advancing the field. Our interdisciplinary teams have created design solutions, in
                        collaboration with architects and other engineers, that reduce fossil fuel use, use recycled
                        materials and use locally available materials in order to help meet sustainable design goals.
